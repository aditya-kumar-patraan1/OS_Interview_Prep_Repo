READER-WRITER PROBLEM

This Problem state that if there is writing operation in file by writer then at that time
no other writer or reader is permit to do their operation

Similarly,if there is reading task carry on by the reader then no writer is allowed to enter and perform their operation but all other reader are allowed to carry on their operation but i synchronized way.

1.)readCount
2.) Mutex
3.) wrt


--->writer

wait(wrt)
CRITICAL SECTION
signal(wrt)

--->reader

wait(mutex)
readCount++
if(readCount == 1){
    wait(wrt)    --> wrt=0
}
signal(mutex)
CRITICAL SECTION 
wait(mutex)
readCount--
if(readCount == 0){
    signal(wrt)   //---> wrt=1
}
signal(mutex)

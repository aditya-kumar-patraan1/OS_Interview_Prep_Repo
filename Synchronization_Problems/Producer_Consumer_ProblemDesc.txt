-->The Producer-Consumer Problem

1.) The Producer-Consumer Problem is a classic synchronization challenge in computer science and operating systems.
2.) It describes a scenario where two types of processes, Producers and Consumers, must share a common, fixed-size buffer (a shared memory area).


The Core Components

1.) The Producer: Its job is to generate data or resources (items) and place them into the buffer.

2.) The Consumer: Its job is to take those items out of the buffer and use them.

3.) The Buffer: This is a shared, temporary storage area with a limited, fixed capacity. It acts as a queue, where the producer adds items to one end and the consumer removes them from the other.

PROBLEM FACE IN PRODUCER-CONSUMER PROBLEM

1.) Buffer Overflow (The Shelf is Full):
The Producer (baker) must not try to add an item to the buffer if it's already full.
Analogy: The baker can't put a new loaf on the shelf if all 10 spots are already filled. They must wait until a customer buys one and frees up a spot.

2.) Buffer Underflow (The Shelf is Empty):
The Consumer (customer) must not try to remove an item from the buffer if it's empty.
Analogy: A customer can't buy a loaf of bread if the shelf is empty. They must wait until the baker bakes a new one and places it on the shelf.

3.) Race Condition (Accessing the Shelf at the Same Time):
The Producer and Consumer must not access and modify the buffer at the exact same time, as this could lead to corrupt data or an inconsistent state.



PSEUDOCODE

mx stands for mutex for mutual Exclusion   -->This is Binary Semaphore
Full(initialize with value 0)   -->This is Counting Semaphore
Empty(initialize with value n)  -->This is also a Counting Semaphore

    wait(empty)  //wait until empty>0 then empty--
